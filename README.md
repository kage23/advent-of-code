These are some of the things I wrote for Advent of Code Coding Challenge. It's a typical [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project, so it you want to run it locally, run `yarn install` and then `yarn start`.

Except for 2024 - that's all in Python. Go to the `src/2024` directory and run the scripts there. Note that you'll have to create some input files in `src/2024/inputs`, though.
