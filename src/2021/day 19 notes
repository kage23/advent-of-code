6 xyzs * 8 +-s = 48 combinations
but there are only 24, bc half of these are mirrors
(maybe doesn't matter if we just go with all 48 anyway, just will take longer)



the orientation of scanner 0 is the "canonical" orientation





algorithm:
for each scanner:
  for each beacon:
    store distances to all other beacons in the scanner set

if one scanner set has exactly 11 distances that match another scanner set, those sets overlap
